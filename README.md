# Shindig - record events

My attempt at a real project in Elixir.  This will ostensibly record events send to it for analysis and aggregation.  Sort of like statsd/graphite but for
applications that don't have tons of traffic.  You want to see every event that comes in, and aren't thinking of them as "metrics", but as an event stream
you might want to analyze.


Currently does almost nothing.
